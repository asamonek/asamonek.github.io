Together with [Let's Phi!](http://www.letsphi.com/) we are kicking off a free online event dedicated to philosophy students interested in following non-academic career paths after graduation and we address the information gap which prevents philosophy graduates from making full use of their position at the job market.

We are offering over 3 hours of workshops and talks with academics, recruiters and professionals from tech, law, IT, consulting and more.

During the meeting we will be testing [Knit - The Group Video Call](https://knit.works/) which helps you engage meaningfully in the social interactions online. Aside from the workshops and talks by philosophers working in different industries, Knit facilitates a number of fireside chats, where you can easily talk to other participants and a bar space, where you can mingle and meet everyone. Wear your best shirt and get your webcam ready!
