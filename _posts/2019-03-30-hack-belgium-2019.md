Last weekend (March 28 - 30, 2019) our team took first place at [Hack Belgium 2019](https://www.hackbelgium.be) in the _Credible, Engaging Media_ category (_Creating new experiences and new sources of trust_).  
We were especially interested in the problem of [creating smarter media consumers](https://www.hackbelgium.be/experiencing-true-media/).

Our app, called _Jamnik_, adds a "credibility layer" to links shared in feeds and private conversations on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, _etc._, by visualising the level of reliability of the news source in the link preview and under a thumbnail of a published link. The analysis of credibility focuses on targeting automatically generated content, forged images and videos, and sources related to known fake news generators.

Our priorities were neutrality, transparency of the evaluation process and user-friendliness, including intuitive representation of the evaluation, fast delivery and eliminating the need of case-by-case evaluation assistance from the user. You can read the upshot of our idea in [the presentation delivered during Hack Belgium 2019](https://prezi.com/p/ybpjfpb7guto/hack-belgium-2019/).
