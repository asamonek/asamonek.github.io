At UCLouvain we are opening a reading group focused on the following book on probabilistic logic (progic) and probabilistic networks:

Haenni, R., Romeijn, J. W., Wheeler, G., & Williamson, J. (2010). Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks (Vol. 350). Springer Science & Business Media.

The book revolves around the results of the research project conducted by Haenni, Romeijn, Wheeler and Williamson between 2006 and 2008.
(View the project page [here](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/projects/progicnet-probabilistic-logic-and-probabilistic-networks/).)

Throughout the semester I will update this page to include the date and time of our meetings, as well as handouts and links.

All interested persons are invited to join.
