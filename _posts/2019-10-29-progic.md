At UCLouvain we are opening a reading group focused on the following book:  

Haenni, R., Romeijn, J. W., Wheeler, G., & Williamson, J. (2010). _Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks_ (Vol. 350). Springer Science & Business Media.

The book concerns the results of a research project conducted by Haenni, Romeijn, Wheeler and Williamson between 2006 and 2008. (View the project page [here](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/projects/progicnet-probabilistic-logic-and-probabilistic-networks/).)

Throughout the semester I will update this page to include the date and time of our meetings, as well as handouts and links. All interested persons are invited to join in.
