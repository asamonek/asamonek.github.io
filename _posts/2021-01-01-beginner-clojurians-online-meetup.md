<i>Hello, everyone!</i> Starting this January, we will be reading <i>Clojure for the Brave and True</i>.

<b>[CBT]</b> Higginbotham, D. (2015). Clojure for the Brave and True: Learn the Ultimate Language and Become a Better Programmer. No Starch Press.

The book was published in open access at:
<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true</a>. <br>
My appreciation to the author, Daniel Higginbotham - thank you for making the book freely available!

<b>About the meeting times.</b> I did my best to find a time slot which would fit in with the maximum number of our time zones, but we may change it if it turns out that there is a better time which suits more people. I would also be willing to set up two meetings for each chapter of the book, so that none of the interested persons is excluded from reading along. Please let me know in case your time zone and/or work schedule don't allow you to join in as things are set up now.

## Venue

The meetings are online and open to all. More information on how to access them is coming soon, so bookmark this page to get the latest updates. (Initially, I will also post on Clojurians slack, fora and social media, but later on the updates there will stop to avoid cluttering the shared cyberspace.)
