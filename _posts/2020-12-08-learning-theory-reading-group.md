Starting December 2020, we will be reading <i>Systems that learn: an introduction to learning theory</i> by Jain, Osherson, Royer and Sharma.

<b>[STL2]</b> Jain, S., Osherson, D., Royer, J. S., & Sharma, A. (1999). Systems that learn: an introduction to learning theory. MIT press.

STL2 is not to be confused with an earlier version of the same book:

<b>The sessions are open to all interested.</b>
