<h2>Hello!</h2>

I am a doctoral researcher at [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html) working on logic and probabilistic networks. In my dissertation I propose an interpretation of hypothetical reasoning in terms of formal learning theory. My approach is multidisciplinary, ranging from logic and theoretical computer science to probability theory, Bayesian networks and machine learning.

My other interests include social, political and economic issues related to digital technologies and applying formal and statistical methods to various problems in social sciences and humanities. My current projects and collaborations are listed in the [Research](https://asamonek.github.io/research/) section.

If you would like to receive updates about my publications, talks and projects, please follow [my blog](https://asamonek.github.io/posts/) or my social media channels.
